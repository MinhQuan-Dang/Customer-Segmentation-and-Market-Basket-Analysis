## 🧹 Data Preparation

The project begins with comprehensive data preprocessing:

- Handling missing values and inconsistencies
- Removing duplicates
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features
- Feature selection for clustering performance

A cleaned dataset was generated to ensure reliable model training and analysis.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key analysis steps included:

- Distribution analysis of customer attributes
- Correlation analysis between numerical variables
- Identification of patterns in customer spending and behavior
- Visualization of demographic segmentation trends

EDA guided feature engineering and model selection decisions.

## 🤖 Clustering Models Implemented

Multiple clustering techniques were applied and compared:

- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Agglomerative Clustering**
- **DBSCAN**

Model evaluation was conducted using:

- Elbow Method
- Silhouette Score
- Cluster distribution visualization
- Business interpretability assessment

## 📈 Segmentation Results

The final segmentation identified distinct customer groups based on:

- Spending behavior
- Demographic characteristics
- Engagement patterns

Each cluster was analyzed and profiled to provide actionable business insights such as:

- High-value customer segments
- Price-sensitive segments
- Low-engagement customers
- Growth opportunity groups

---

## 💡 Business Applications

The segmentation results can support:

- Targeted marketing campaigns
- Customer retention strategies
- Personalized product recommendations
- Resource allocation optimization

---

## 🚀 Key Takeaways

- Clustering algorithms reveal meaningful behavioral customer groups.
- Proper preprocessing and feature scaling significantly impact clustering quality.
- Model comparison ensures selection of the most interpretable and business-relevant segmentation.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Implement advanced clustering techniques (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models).
- Integrate dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) for improved visualization.
- Deploy the segmentation pipeline as a scalable service.
- Combine clustering with predictive modeling for churn forecasting.
